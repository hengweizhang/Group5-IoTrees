= Project: {Plant Care System}

With our Project we aim to create a system that tracks certain measurements of a plant and sends them to the Arduino Cloud Platform for an individual or business to track. In total we are tracking the plant's soil humidity and environment temperature, brightness and humidity. Based on the soil humidity, we have implemented an automatic watering systems that always waters the plant when its humidity falls under a certain level. 

=== Folder structure

....
 IoTrees_MC_nov18a                => Arduino sketch folder
  ├── IoTrees_MC_nov18a.ino       => main Arduino file
  ├── ReadMe.adoc                 => explaining general information of project
  ├── arduino_secrets.h           => specifiying wifi passport and secret device key to connect to cloud, only uploaded as we                                       are working on a prototype, normally this file should be kept secret!
  ├── sketch.json                 => 
  └── thingProperties.h           => devining Things which properties will be sent to Arduino Cloud
